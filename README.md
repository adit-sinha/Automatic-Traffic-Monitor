To prevent accidents, ultrasonic sensors would be fit on each side of intersection of roads. Fitted a few meters away from the junction, the cars would be alerted with a response time of 0.4 seconds. When these sensors detect that two cars may collide if they keep proceeding, the driver will be alerted through a strong alarm.
This would prevent cars travelling in perpendicular directions from crashing and would resynchronize the flow of traffic therefore making the roads less busy.

**Accident Detection Circuit:**

Our project uses an impact sensor, and an accelerometer which detects the accident which has taken place. If it detects an accident, it notifies the nearby ambulance, police and victim's family members, providing them with the location coordinates using the GPS module. It notifies them using the GSM Module. The sensing system would be linked to the car's accident sensors which would be used along with the impact sensor and the accelerometer to detect whether an accident has taken place.

**Notes:**
1) Sensing system in Accident Detection Circuit to be improved upon.
